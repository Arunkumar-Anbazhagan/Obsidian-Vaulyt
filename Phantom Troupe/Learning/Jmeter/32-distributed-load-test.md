# 32. Distributed Load Test   
### Why :   
So in real world scenario the user will not be in the same page for the timebeing , Multiple users may be in Homepage, some in payment portal, Login window …   
To simulate this , we can use the throughput controller    
Threads (virtual users) - 10
WebApplication
WebPage A - 20% - 2
WebPage B - 30% - 3
WebPage C - 50% - 5
